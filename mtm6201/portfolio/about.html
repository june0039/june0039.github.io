    <h1>Love With Passion</h1>
    <p> Love with Passion began as a labour<br>
    of love for artist Julie Juneau. Julie<br>
went back to college in her later years<br>
    after nursing for 12 years while raising<br>
three boys on her own.Realizing that there was no free time to work on her<br>
passions for art, she decided to make it her work instead! During hre first year<br>
of college of Interactive Media Design, she found her passion in photography and Web Design.<br>
Julie began focusing on independent freelance work while <br>
finishing up school. Love with Passion began as an online<br>
freelance page created in UX/UI Design classes and completed in Web Design<br>
Julie is now photographing weddings, designing logos and<br>
completing her course for a diploma.<br>
Plans for a studio and gardens are in the near future! </p>

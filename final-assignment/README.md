    This program was developed for Responsive Web 2 class and is to demonstrate a Portfolio with three pages for myself as a student. Here we are to include displays of works of art,photography, videography and any designs and logos we wish of our own creation. This is also to be used as a personal portfolio page and can be given as a link for jobs. It has a variety of pictures displayed on the portfolio page that include works or art, photographs and Ux design pages. The about page will display a portrait of myself along with a brief description about me and what is in the porfolio. The contact page will list a contact email and a message me system for viewers to contact me.
